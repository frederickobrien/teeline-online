	<p>
		teeline.online is a free, interactive learning resource for Teeline shorthand. It is developed
		by <a href="https://frederickobrien.com">Frederick O'Brien</a>, a software engineer and
		occasional journalist based in London. It's mainly a way of avoiding the revision he should be
		doing to reach 100 wpm.
	</p>
	<p>
		The source code is published on <a href="https://github.com/gonzo-engineering/teeline-online"
			>GitHub</a
		>
		and the data at its core is available at
		<a href="/api/outlines">this API endpoint</a>. The font is based on Fred's own handwriting - a
		nod to the project being partly inspired by the revision flash cards he made while studying for
		his own NCTJ diploma.
	</p>
	<p>
		The site has become a centrepiece of the <a href="https://gonzo.engineering"
			>Gonzo Engineering</a
		>
		project, which creates free, open-source tools for journalists and artists. You can support development
		by <a href="https://ko-fi.com/frederickobrien">buying Fred a coffee</a> or
