### The basics

Shorthand is a way of writing lots of words really quickly. Teeline is a type of shorthand and the recommended system of the [National Council for the Training of Journalists](https://www.nctj.com/). Trainees need 60 words per minute (wpm) to get their NCTJ diploma, while 100 is needed to achieve the 'gold standard'. Some can write as fast as 120 wpm and beyond.

The general idea is to remove as many letters as possible and write the word in as few strokes as possible.
