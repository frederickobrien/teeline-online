	<h2 style="text-align: center;">About</h2>
	<p>
		This is teeline.online, a free, interactive learning resource for Teeline shorthand. It is
		developed by <a href="https://frederickobrien.com">Frederick O'Brien</a>, a software engineer
		and occasional journalist based in London. It's mainly a way of avoiding the revision he should
		be doing to reach 100 wpm.
	</p>
	<p>
		The source code is publicly available on <a
			href="https://github.com/frederickobrien/teeline-online">GitHub</a
		>
		and the data at its core is available <a href="/data/outlines.json">here</a>. The site is built
		with
		<a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>
		and hosted on <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. The font is based on Fred's own
		handwriting - a nod to the project being partly inspired by the revision flash cards he made
		while studying for his own NCTJ diploma.
