# teeline.online

A (short)handy tool for learning and practicing Teeline.

### Potential ideas and features

- Teeline alphabet
- Revision page that shows outlines/words and users practice reading/writing them
- Literary passages and speeches read by text-to-speech software to for transcription practice
- Users can practice 'writing' outlines using their mouse or a touchscreen input, like in [this Stack Overflow example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39050460/drawing-on-canvas-using-touchscreen-devices)
- Use SVG lines to replicate outlines and connect them where appropriate
- Break down the journey from word to shorthand (word -> disemvowelment -> outline)
- Highlight outlines when hovering over longhand equivalent, and vice versa
